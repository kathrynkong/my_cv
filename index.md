### About me

Embarking on my PhD journey in the T&T program, I merge my background in engineering and translation studies with my passion for gaming narratives, computer-assisted translation, and language education. My experience as a translator and game localization specialist fuels my research in game narratives, digital storytelling, game-based language pedagogy, and computer-assisted language learning.

### Research Interests

- Video Game Narratives and Digital Storytelling, Video Game Localization  
- Machine Translation, Computer-assisted Language Learning (CALL), and Game-based Learning
