I chose the novel 'A Room with A View' as my project texts.

This project is basically created step by step according to the requirements of this assignment. To be frank, I found this assignment much more difficult than the previous one, and it took me much longer to complete it. I am not satisfied with it, as I can see a lot of imperfection of it, like a less clear coding structure. I can see part of the reason is that I am not very familiar with all the strings, variables and functions that I am using. So just got lost when there are more functions realized in a single program. In addition, the coding process really requires logic thinking ability.
